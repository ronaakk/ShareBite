# ShareBite

ShareBite is a platform that connects restaurants with local homeless shelters to donate leftover food, reducing waste and supporting the community.

## The problem it solves
In the restaurant and fast food industry, a significant amount of food goes to waste each day simply because it wasnâ€™t sold, as new batches are prepared daily. In the United States alone, around 84.3% of unused food is wasted, only 14% is recycled, and just 1.4% is donated (https://www.fourth.com/article/how-much-food-restaurants-waste). Meanwhile, many cities are facing rising homelessness, overcrowded shelters, and limited resources to support those in need. Our platform provides a solution by connecting restaurants with nearby shelters to help reduce food waste and meet local demand. Restaurants can quickly list their available surplus, while shelters receive real-time updates on nearby donations, allowing both to work together in providing food to the community and making a tangible impact.
